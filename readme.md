# Traffic System Simulation with Intelligent Signal Control

This project is a simulation of a traffic system created using Unity, designed to mimic real-world traffic with signals, intersections, and over a hundred vehicles. The simulation is enhanced with a vehicle detection model built using OpenCV and TensorFlow. This model tracks the number of vehicles at each intersection and dynamically adjusts the signal timings based on traffic density, ensuring a more efficient flow of traffic.
